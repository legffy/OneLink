# OneLink
## Overiew
OneLink aims to serve a single unified launchpad for campus life at RPI, combining events, activities, and reservations from multiple university systems into one intuitive platform. Currently, students must navigate several applications to answer simple questions, such as whether the Armory is open for pickup basketball. OneLink addresses this fragmentation by providing fast access to campus information in one place, reducing confusion and improving day-to-day accessibility for students.
